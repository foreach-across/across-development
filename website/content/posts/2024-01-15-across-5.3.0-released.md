Across Framework and Platform 5.3.0 was released today. The one big
change is that Across development has moved to an internal GitLab
server, with the repositories also mirrored to
[GitHub](https://github.com/ForeachOS).

The Across modules have been reorganized into a much smaller number of
git repositories, to ease the release process. As a result of this,
there are a few small changes you need in your application.

For the details see the [Release notes](/release-notes/5.3.0).
