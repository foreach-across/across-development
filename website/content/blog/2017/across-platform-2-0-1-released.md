Across Platform 2.0.1 has been released, including several new versions
of standard modules. Some new libraries (and the first public version
of WebCmsModule) have been added as well.See
the <a href="http://across-docs.foreach.be/across-platform/2.0.1.RELEASE/reference/#_2_0_1_release" class="external-link">

### Across Initializr

Not so long ago we also
launched http://start-across.foreach.be to
quickly generate Across based projects with common settings. Projects
generated with the Across Initializr use platform-bom 2.0.1 as well.
