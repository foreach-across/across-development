Across Platform 2.0.0 has been released and this includes new release
versions for several modules. See
the [reference documentation](https://docs.across.dev/across-platform/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/#_dependency_versions)
for an overview of the different module versions.

Anyone working with platform-bom 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT should switch as soon as
possible as the SNAPSHOT versions will be removed from the repository.

The Across starter project has been updated for release 2.0.0 as well.
