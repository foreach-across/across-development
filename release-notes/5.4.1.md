The `5.4.1` release consists mainly of:

- Adaptations for compatibility with recent Azure changes and SDK's.

- Pointers to the new website: https://foreach-across.github.io/


<!--more-->

## Upgrades

Upgrades compared to `5.4.0`:

- Spring Framework: `5.3.32`

- Apache Tomcat: `9.0.86`

- Azure SDK BOM: `1.2.21` for `com.azure:azure-storage-blob:12.25.2`.
  Note that this does not propagate to applications: you'll have to
  upgrade the Azure SDK BOM yourself there.


## Website pointers

Pointers to the old website have been replaced with pointers to the
new site:

https://foreach-across.github.io


## GitHub mirrors

The GitHub mirrors of the internal repositories have been moved to:

## Compatibility with Azure MySQL Flexible Server configuration

Azure has enabled [Generated Invisible Primary
Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-limitations#generated-invisible-primary-keys)
([MySQL
Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-gipks.html))
in [Azure MySQL Flexible
Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview)
since [August
2023](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/whats-new#august-2023).

That's generally a good choice, so we don't want to disable that. The
problem was that the Liquibase `AcrossCoreSchemaInstaller.xml` script
was not compatible with GIPK enabled. That has been fixed with a
`mysql` specific `changeSet` that drops and creates the primary key
for `ACROSSMODULES` in a single command.


## Switch AzureFileRepository to the new Azure SDK

The {{< maven-central-ref com.microsoft.azure azure-storage >}} SDK
has been [deprecated since March
2023](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/deprecated/java.html).

The `AzureFileRepository` class from the {{< module-ref
file-manager-module >}} has been adapted to use the new {{<
maven-central-ref com.azure azure-storage-blob >}} SDK using [the
migration
guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob/migrationGuides/V10_V12.md).

You will need to follow the instructions in that migration guide, in
order to pass a `com.azure.storage.blob.BlobServiceClient` to the
builder of
[`AzureFileRepository`](https://foreach-across.github.io/api-docs-6/com.foreach.across.modules/file-manager-module/6.4.1/com/foreach/across/modules/filemanager/services/AzureFileRepository.AzureFileRepositoryBuilder.html)


## Internal changes

In the `across-entity-admin-modules` repository, the end-to-end tests
are now run with Cypress 5 instead of Cypress 4.
