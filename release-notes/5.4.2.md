The `5.4.2` release has only a single fix: a forgotten `2.4.13` Spring
Boot version in `across-application-parent` has been replaced with the
correct `2.6.15`.


<!--more-->

## Impact

This bug affects all applications which are using
`across-application-parent` as their parent POM, and that are probably
all of them, except one (See [the reason behind the 5.2.2 release]({{<
relref "5.2.2.md" >}})).

The impact is that all of those applications were actually still using
Spring Boot 2.4.13 (and the dependencies that go with that).

Applications that already "upgraded" will have to upgrade to Across
Platform 5.4.2, and will need to be retested.
