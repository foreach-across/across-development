Across 6.0 upgrades to Spring Boot 3.2, which includes many upgrades:

- Minimum Java 17; 21 is supported too.
- Spring Framework 6.1
- Spring Security 6.2
- Hibernate 6.4
- Tomcat 10.1
- And of course Jakarta EE, which renames many packages from `javax.*`
  to `jakarta.*` (but not all!)

Changes in Across itself are relatively limited, except for a number
of modules that have been removed.

## Release notes

First of all, please read these release notes entirely, before you
start anything.

It's also a good idea to read the various Spring release notes:

- [Spring Boot 3.0 release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Release-Notes)
- [Spring Boot 3.1 release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.1-Release-Notes)
- [Spring Boot 3.2 release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.2-Release-Notes)

and:

- [Spring Framework 6.0 release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-6.0-Release-Notes)
- [Spring Framework 6.1 release notes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-6.1-Release-Notes)

Hibernate:

- [Hibernate 6.0](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.0/migration-guide/migration-guide.html)
- [Hibernate 6.1](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/migration-guide/migration-guide.html)

notes](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Releases). Spring
Boot 3.2 uses Jackson 2.15.


## Version numbers lined up to 6.0 for all modules

All modules now have the same 6.y.z version number as Across Framework
and Across Platform, which is a lot easier to manage. This means it is
no longer possible to release a module by itself, but that's ok:

- Pretty much the only changes in Across nowadays are for Spring Boot
  upgrades, and you want to test all modules with each upgrade anyway.
- In practice, we haven't done a per-module release in years anyway.
- And a per-module release hasn't been possible since [we merged a
  series of Git repositories in Across 5.3.0]({{<relref
  "5.3.0.md#git-repositories">}})

Note that this was only possible, because the `across-media-modules`
repository (whose modules were already numbered 6.y.z) was removed,
which is explained in the next section.


## across-media-modules repository and modules have been removed

The biggest change in Across 6 itself is that the
[across-media-modules](https://github.com/foreach-across/across-media-modules)
repository with the following modules has been removed:

- {{< module-ref file-manager-module >}}
- {{< module-ref web-cms-module >}}
- {{< module-ref imageserver-admin >}}

The reason is that {{< module-ref web-cms-module >}} is a very large
and complicated module, which was only used for a single project
anymore, where it can be replaced with a much simpler
solution. `web-cms-module` has dependencies on `image-server` and
`file-manager-module`, but nothing in Across (Platform) itself has any
dependencies on those.

- We have no active projects that need `image-server` anymore, so that
  could easily be removed.
- `file-manager-module` has been removed as well, but an alternative
  is provided for that, which is described in the next section.

Update: By the time Across 6 is being released, the last project that
used `web-cms-module` has been decided to end, so the replacement with
a simpler solution is not even needed there.


## FCJL common-file-manager

So the {{< module-ref file-manager-module >}} has been removed in
6.0.0.  We have however extracted part of it in the [Foreach Common
Java Libraries (FCJL)]({{< relref "fcjl-2.0.0.md#common-file-manager"
>}})

If you depend on the `file-manager-module`, we recommend that you
first replace the Across `file-manager-module` with the
`common-file-manager` from FCJL 2.0 (details are in those release
notes), *before* upgrading to Across 6.

See those [FCJL 2.0.0/3.0.0 Release notes]({{< relref
"fcjl-2.0.0.md#common-file-manager" >}}) for detailed instructions to
switch.

However, you can only do these steps if you are *not* depending on {{<
module-ref web-cms-module >}} or {{< module-ref imageserver-admin >}}.


## ehcache-module changes

The migration to EHCache 3 is probably the biggest dependency upgrade
in the context of Spring Boot 3: EHCache 3 is essentially a full rewrite
of EHCache 2.

One of the major changes in EHCache 3 is that there are now three
possible layers of caching:

- Java Heap

- In process memory, but outside the Java Heap ("off-heap"). If you
  use this with Kubernetes, make sure that the memory limits are
  adjusted appropriately!

- Disk, which you probably don't want to use. In fact, the Hibernate
  6.4 User Guide warns [at the end of the JCache
  section](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching-provider-jcache)
  that this is enabled by default, and you should probably disable it.

Sticking with EHCache 2 is not an option:

- EHCache 2 uses Java EE API's
  ([source](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-6.0-Release-Notes#removed-apis)),
  so it is fundamentally incompatible with Spring Framework 6, which
  requires Jakarta EE (e.g. the whole `javax` -> `jakarta` migration).
- It is also [EOL since September 2023](https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache2).
- The first version of EHCache 3 was already released in 2016, so it's
  pretty reasonable that the EHCache developers expect you to upgrade.
- It would be a negative investment of time anyway: better bite the
  bullet and learn EHCache 3.

The migration guide for EHCache 3 can be found here:

https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.10/migration-guide.html

but it's very minimal.

One of the major changes is that EHCache is now an
[implementation](https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.10/107.html)
of the [JSR-107 "JCache"](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107)
standard. This opened up some options for other projects:

- [Direct EHCache support was removed from Spring Framework
  6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30641). The
  {{< module-ref ehcache-module >}} in Across 6 works with EHCache
  3.10 (upgraded from 2.10 in Across 5.5). Integrating Spring with
  EHCache is now [supposed to go via the JSR-107
  JCache](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-6.0-Release-Notes#removed-apis).

- Hibernate has in fact done the exact same thing: the
  `hibernate-ehcache` module does not exist anymore in
  Hibernate 6. This is not explicitly mentioned in the [6.0 migration
  guide](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.0/migration-guide/migration-guide.html)
  though, it is sort of implied in the [6.4 User
  Guide](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching-provider-jcache-cache-manager),
  which shows how to integrate via EHCache using the
  `hibernate-jcache` module.  In the 5.6, there there used to be [a
  dedicated EHCache
  section](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.6/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching-provider-ehcache).

It is no longer possible to define caches programmatically in the
Across `ehcache-module`: this was deemed to much effort, and most
(all?) applications probably configure it through the `ehcache.xml`
file. Note that the [format of that
file](https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.10/xml.html) has been
completely changed as well in EHCache 3.

Support for EHCache in the {{< module-ref debug-web-module >}} has
been reduced as well:

- The `DebugEhcacheController` from {{< module-ref ehcache-module >}}
  has been disabled, because most of the info that was shown there, is
  simply not available anymore in EHCache 3.

- The `CacheController` (the [Cache managers
  page](http://localhost:8080/debug/cache/cacheManagers)) in {{<
  module-ref debug-web-module >}} itself is still there, and also
  allows clearing the cache(s). The per-cache detail page however does
  no longer show any details about the entries, because that info is
  no longer available in the EHCache 3 API.

The Cache statistics that are now shown are coming mainly from the JMX
support for JCache, using the
[CacheStatisticsMXBean](https://www.javadoc.io/static/javax.cache/cache-api/1.0.0/javax/cache/management/CacheStatisticsMXBean.html)
Note in particular that this does *not* include the number of elements
in a cache, and that field is blank in the {{< module-ref
debug-web-module >}} UI.

There are two new `boolean` configuration options (both defaulting to
`false`):

- `ehcache-module.always-determine-cache-size`: This does allow
  showing the number of entries in the cache, by iterating over the
  the entire cache. Besides the obvious cost of that, there is another
  hidden cost: iterating through all entries counts as a cache hit
  *for each entry*! So every time you visit a Cache page in the
  `/debug/cache/` page it affects the hit count and the hit ratio (hit
  %).

- `ehcache-module.show-cache-entries`: By default, the cache entries
  are no longer shown when you visit the detail page of a specific
  cache. Again, because this affects the hit count and the hit ratio.

So by default, the debug support in {{< module-ref ehcache-module >}}
does the right thing (not affect the hit count/ratio), but you have an
opt-in option if you're willing to bear the cost.

Clearing caches is still supported of course.


## Jakarta EE

The introduction of Jakarta EE renames many packages from `javax.*` to
`jakarta.*`, but not all (not `javax.sql` for instance, because that's
part of the regular JDK, which is still under control of Oracle).
For background, see:

https://www.google.com/search?q=jakarta+package+rename

Luckily there are tools that greatly help with this (see the [last
section about the recommended migration steps]({{< ref
"#recommended-upgrade-steps" >}})).

Tip: Watch especially out for configuration files such as:

- Across Autoconfigure config files: `across-configuration.yml`.
- SPI configuration files under the `/META-INF/services/` directory.

Tip: If you get this compiler error:

	Fatal error compiling: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/persistence/Entity: javax.persistence.Entity

and you have no references anywhere to `javax.persistence`, make sure
you're using QueryDSL jars with the `jakarta` classifier. For
instance:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.querydsl</groupId>
		<artifactId>querydsl-apt</artifactId>
		<classifier>jakarta</classifier>
		<scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>

The only dependencies in Across 6 that require the `jakarta`
classifier are QueryDSL and EHCache, but your project may have other
dependencies that also require the `jakarta` classifier. All other
dependencies (such as Hibernate etc) are directly dependent on the
Jakarta API's.

I would have expected that the `pom.xml` of `spring-boot-dependencies`
would configure this correctly, but unfortunately it does not seem
consistent: for instance, it mentions the `jakarta` classifier for
EHCache, but not for QueryDSL.


## Liquibase 4.27

Spring Boot 3.2 comes with Liquibase 4.24, but Across requires at least 4.27.


## Hibernate

In many cases, it's no longer necessary to explicitly set the
Hibernate SQL dialect, so if you see a warning like this:

	HHH90000025: MySQL8Dialect does not need to be specified explicitly using 'hibernate.dialect' (remove the property setting and it will be selected by default)
	HHH90000026: MySQL8Dialect has been deprecated; use org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect instead

it's safe to remove this setting:

	acrossHibernate:
	  hibernate-properties:
        hibernate.dialect: "org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect"


## Thymeleaf 3.1

Thymeleaf 3.1 is a lot stricter, for security reasons:

https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html

in particular:

- https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html#removal-of-web-api-based-expression-utility-objects

- https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html#tighter-restrictions-on-the-use-of-classes-in-expressions

How to deal with this is explained further in the What's new:

https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html#expression-restrictions


## Spring MVC

### @Controller is required

`@Controller` is now required on a controller, in the past
`@RequestMapping` was sufficient (if the bean was somehow picked up
through component scanning or an `@Bean`).


### MultiValueMap for application/x-www-form-urlencoded

In a @Controller, it does not appear to work anymore to decode form
data into a `MultiValueMap` parameter:

	@RequestBody MultiValueMap<String, String> data

Using `@RequestParam` does work:

	@RequestParam MultiValueMap<String, String> data

but that will contain all other (regular) request parameters as well.


## Date and time formatting changes because of CLDR

Date and time formatting has changed because of [JEP252: Use CLDR
Locale Data by Default](https://openjdk.org/jeps/252).


## Logback and Thymeleaf

Check whether you have this in your `logback-spring.xml` or
`logback.xml` (or any other variant) file(s):

	org.thymeleaf.spring5.messageresolver.SpringMessageResolver

Replace that with the Spring 6 version:

	org.thymeleaf.spring6.messageresolver.SpringMessageResolver


## Logback logs disappearing

If your logs are disappearing after the Spring Boot / Across banner,
and you are using this ElasticSearch appender:

https://github.com/internetitem/logback-elasticsearch-appender

then your problem is *NOT* that that is not compatible with Logback
1.4 that comes with Spring Boot 3.2. That appender project seems
indeed unmaintained, and there are [several
forks](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=logback-elasticsearch-appender). I
tried this one, but was not entirely able to get that to work either:

https://github.com/agido-malter/logback-elasticsearch-appender/

In fact, the *real* problem is likely a major change in Spring Boot 3,
that comes with the upgrade to Logback 1.4: In Spring Boot 2, you
could use `<springProfile` at any level of the `logback-spring.xml`
file, whereas in Spring Boot 3, it can only be used directly under the
top-level `<configuration>` element, not inside the `<appender>`,
`<logger>` nor `<root>` elements (etc).


## Recommended upgrade steps

We recommend that you do the migration to Across 6.0 with the
following steps:

1. Use the [OpenRewrite Spring Boot 2.7 recipe](
   https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/spring/boot2/upgradespringboot_2_7)
   to automatically do the upgrade your Spring Boot 2.7.

   Tip: Use the "Maven Command Line" option to run OpenRewrite: it
   does not involve installing anything yourself, nor does it require
   modifying your `pom.xml`. It's just the easiest option.

   Your code might not compile or run at this point, but you should
   commit it anyway, so you have a clear difference between what was
   automatically changed, and what was manually changed.

2. Then manually upgrade to [Across 5.5]({{<relref 5.5.0.md >}}): The
   Spring Security adaptations that you need to make there, are also
   needed in 6.0, but it will be much easier to do that step
   separately.

3. Switch from using the `across-application-parent` to using the
   `across-platform-bom`. Why and how is explained in detail in the
   [Replacing the Across Application Parent POM with the Across
   Platform BOM post]({{<ref "/blog/2024/2024-12-16-across-bom.md" >}}).

4. If you are using the {{< module-ref file-manager-module >}},
   replace it with the `common-file-manager` module from the Foreach
   Common Java Libraries. See [above]({{<ref
   "#fcjl-common-file-manager" >}}) for details and restrictions.

5. Use the [OpenRewrite Java 21
   recipe](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/migrate/upgradetojava21)
   to upgrade to Java 21. This boils down to running a single Maven
   command, and probably manually fixing a few issues. You may also
   need to upgrade some libraries for compatibility with Java 21. It
   might also not be possible to go to 21 at once, but only to 17.

   The reason to do this as a separate step, is that the OpenRewrite
   for Spring Boot 3 will of course do the Java 17 upgrade as well:
   this way, that's a separate step, outside the Across upgrade, that
   you can test separately. It's also a separate commit in your
   history, which means the Spring Boot upgrade commit (see further)
   is smaller and more to the point.

6. It's implied that you test your application after each of the
   previous (and next) steps, but now is a good moment to do a bigger
   test, possibly involving QA. Make sure everything is OK in
   acceptance, and ideally you should put it in production after this
   step. This ensures at least that your application works with Spring
   Boot 2.7 and Java 21.

7. Use the [OpenRewrite Spring Boot 3.2 recipe](
   https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/spring/boot3/upgradespringboot_3_2)
   to automatically do the upgrade to Spring Boot 3.2. Since this is a
   compound recipe, this will do a whole bunch of other upgrades,
   including [upgrading to Java
   17](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/migrate/upgradetojava17),
   but that should have no effect since you've already upgraded to
   Java 21. Your code will obviously not compile at this point, but
   you should commit it anyway: this way, the gigantic amount of
   `import javax.` -> `import.jakarta.` changes are in a separate
   commit, so they don't pollute the rest of the Across 6 upgrade.

8. Change the top-level Maven `pom.xml` file to point to Across 6.0.0:

		<foreach-common-bom.version>3.0.0</foreach-common-bom.version>
        <across-framework.version>6.0.0</across-framework.version>
        <across-platform.version>6.0.0</across-platform.version>

   Then fix any compilation problems, based on the information above,
   and the release notes and migration guides of all the third-party
   libraries.
