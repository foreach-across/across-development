Across 6.0 upgrades to Spring Boot 3.2, which includes many upgrades:

- Minimum Java 17; 21 is supported too.
- Spring Framework 6.1
- Spring Security 6.1
- Hibernate 6.4
- Tomcat 10.1
- And of course Jakara EE, which renames many packages from `javax.*`
  to `jakarta.*` (but not all!)

Changes in Across itself are relatively limited, except for a number
of modules that have been removed.

## Upgrade recommendations

Upgrade first to [Across 5.5]({{<relref 5.5.0.md >}}), especially the Spring Security
adaptations that you need to make there, are also needed in 6.0, but
it will be much easier to do that step separately.

If you are using the {{< module-ref file-manager-module >}}, replace
it with the `common-file-manager` module from the Foreach Common Java
Libraries (see below).


## across-media-modules repository and modules have been removed

The biggest change in Across 6 itself is that the
[across-media-modules](https://github.com/foreach-across/across-media-modules)
repository with the following modules has been removed:

- {{< module-ref file-manager-module >}}
- {{< module-ref web-cms-module >}}
- {{< module-ref imageserver-admin >}}

The reason is that {{< module-ref web-cms-module >}} is a very large
and complicated module, which was only used for a single project
anymore, where it can be replaced with a much simpler
solution. `web-cms-module` has dependencies on `image-server` and
`file-manager-module`, but we don't need those anymore either.

We have however extracted part of the {{< module-ref
file-manager-module >}} in the [Foreach Common Java Libraries
(FCJL)]({{< relref fcjl-2.0.0.md >}}). If you depend on the
`file-manager-module`, we recommend:

1. First replace the Across `file-manager-module` with the
   `common-file-manager` from FCJL 2.0 (details are in those release
   notes).

2. Only then upgrade to Across 6.


## ehcache-module changes

[Direct EHCache support was removed from Spring Framework
6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/30641). The
{{< module-ref ehcache-module >}} in Across 6 works with EHCache 3.10
(upgraded from 2.10 in Across 5.5).

It is no longer possible to define caches programmatically: it is only
possible through the `ehcache.xml` file. Note that the [format of that
file](https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.10/xml.html) has been
completely changed as well in EHCache 3.

The migration guide for EHCache 3 can be found here:

https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.10/migration-guide.html

Support for EHCache in the {{< module-ref debug-web-module >}} has
been reduced as well:

- The `DebugEhcacheController` from {{< module-ref ehcache-module >}}
  has been disabled, because most of the info that was shown there, is
  simply not available anymore in EHCache 3.

- The `CacheController` (the [Cache managers
  page](http://localhost:8080/debug/cache/cacheManagers)) in {{<
  module-ref debug-web-module >}} itself is still there, and also
  allows clearing the cache(s). The per-cache detail page however does
  no longer show any details about the entries, because that info is
  no longer available in the EHCache 3 API.

## Jakarta EE

For the Jakarta migration, watch especially out for configuration files such as:

- Across Autoconfigure config files: `across-configuration.yml`.
- SPI configuration files under the `/META-INF/services/` directory.

If you get this compiler error:

	Fatal error compiling: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/persistence/Entity: javax.persistence.Entity

and you have references anywhere to `javax.persistence`, make sure
you're using QueryDSL jars with the `jakarta` classifier. For instance:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.querydsl</groupId>
		<artifactId>querydsl-apt</artifactId>
		<classifier>jakarta</classifier>
		<scope>provided</scope>
	</dependency>

`jakarta` classifier is necessary for at least:

- QueryDSL
- EHCache
- ...

I would have expected that the `pom.xml` for
`spring-boot-dependencies` would be good place for an overview of
this, but unfortunately it's not: for instance, it mentions the
`jakarta` classifier for EHCache, but not for QueryDSL.


## Liquibase 4.27

Spring Boot 3.2 comes with Liquibase 4.24, but Across requires at least 4.27.


## Hibernate

In many cases, it's no longer necessary to explicitly set the
Hibernate SQL dialect, so if you see a warning like this:

	HHH90000025: MySQL8Dialect does not need to be specified explicitly using 'hibernate.dialect' (remove the property setting and it will be selected by default)
	HHH90000026: MySQL8Dialect has been deprecated; use org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect instead

it's safe to remove this setting:

	acrossHibernate:
	  hibernate-properties:
        hibernate.dialect: "org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect"


## Thymeleaf 3.1

Thymeleaf 3.1 is a lot stricter, for security reasons:

https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html

in particular:

- https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html#removal-of-web-api-based-expression-utility-objects

- https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html#tighter-restrictions-on-the-use-of-classes-in-expressions

How to deal with this is explained further in the What's new:

https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/articles/thymeleaf31whatsnew.html#expression-restrictions


## Spring MVC

### @Controller is required

`@Controller` is now required on a controller, in the past
`@RequestMapping` was sufficient (if the bean was somehow picked up
through component scanning or an `@Bean`).


### MultiValueMap for application/x-www-form-urlencoded

In a @Controller, it does not appear to work anymore to decode form
data into a `MultiValueMap` parameter:

	@RequestBody MultiValueMap<String, String> data

Using `@RequestParam` does work:

	@RequestParam MultiValueMap<String, String> data

but it will contain all other (regular) request parameters as well.


## Date and time formatting changes because of CLDR

Date and time formatting changes because of [JEP252: Use CLDR Locale Data
by Default](https://openjdk.org/jeps/252).


## Logback and Thymeleaf

Check whether you have this in your `logback-spring.xml` or
`logback.xml` (or any other variant) file(s):

	org.thymeleaf.spring5.messageresolver.SpringMessageResolver

Replace that with the Spring 6 version:

	org.thymeleaf.spring6.messageresolver.SpringMessageResolver


## Logback logs disappearing

If your logs are disappearing after the Spring Boot / Across banner,
and you are using this ElasticSearch appender:

https://github.com/internetitem/logback-elasticsearch-appender

then your problem is that that is not compatible with Logback 1.4 that
comes with Spring Boot 3.2. There are [several
forks](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=logback-elasticsearch-appender). I
tried this one, but was not entirely able to get that to work either:

https://github.com/agido-malter/logback-elasticsearch-appender/

TODO: See fix in Project C.
