The main change in Across 5.4 is the upgrade from Spring Boot 2.4 to
2.6. This required no changes in the Across code itself, only a few
minor changes in tests. If you are on Across 5.2 or 5.3, it should be
almost trivial to upgrade.

Note that Spring Boot 2.5 is the first version [to support Java
17](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.x/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started.system-requirements),
so it should finally be possible to upgrade, but this hasn't been
tested at this moment. FYI, all Across 5.x releases are still built
with Java 8.

## Code changes

Spring Boot 2.6 required an NPE fix in `across-web`, but that fix
was already included in [5.2.2](5.2.2.md).

In the `user-module`, many services have a new `findBy` method,
because the
`org.springframework.data.querydsl.QuerydslPredicateExecutor`
interface added that method.

In the main code, that's all that was changed.

In the tests, the only code changes were adaptations for the upgrade
to Mockito 4: the deprecated method `verifyZeroInteractions` has been
removed, and all calls had to be replaced with `verifyNoInteractions`
or `verifyNoMoreInteractions`.


## Configuration changes

The Maven coordinates for the Oracle JDBC driver have changed: See the
[Spring Boot 2.6 Release notes](
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.6-Release-Notes#oracle-database-driver-dependency-management)
for details.

[Since Spring Boot 2.6, circular bean references are prohibited by
default](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.6-Release-Notes#circular-references-prohibited-by-default). For
all Across tests, this has been reverted back.

Idem for [PathPattern Based Path Matching Strategy for Spring
MVC](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.6-Release-Notes#pathpattern-based-path-matching-strategy-for-spring-mvc).

Both options still exist in [Spring Boot
3.2](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.2.x/reference/html/application-properties.html#appendix.application-properties),
so they shouldn't cause a problem for the future upgrade to Spring
Boot 3.


## Removed features

Support for `Solr` has been removed from `entity-module`, because
[Spring Data Solr has been
discontinued](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-solr/). Note that
in fact no changes were made to the main code of `entity-module`
itself: it's just that the tests have been removed.


## Thanks

Thanks to:

- Arno for testing a snapshot build with a client application.
