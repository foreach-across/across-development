## Lombok upgrade

Spring Boot 2.7 has upgraded to [Lombok
1.18.30](https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/blob/master/doc/changelog.markdown#v11830-september-20th-2023)
from 1.18.26.

In one of the client projects, we gotten bitten by the "IMPROBABLE
BREAKING CHANGE" in [Lombok
1.18.24](https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/blob/master/doc/changelog.markdown#v11824-april-18th-2022). Note
that it's not just "copy some of these new annotations", but also
actually introduces null checks. This includes for instance
`javax.annotation.Nonnull`.

What's even weirder: Spring Boot 2.6 (Across 5.4) actually already
used
[1.18.26](https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/blob/master/doc/changelog.markdown#v11826-feb-3rd-2023)
(e.g. a (newer) release). I've tracked that the behaviour change is
indeed in
[1.18.28](https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/blob/master/doc/changelog.markdown#v11828-may-24th-2023),
not in 1.18.24: so the release notes seem wrong. But it may be rather
the change that triggered it:


Despite that's about `jakarta.annotation.Nonnull`, not
`javax.annotation.Nonnull`.


## Spring Security


You probably need to review any:

	@ModuleConfiguration(SpringSecurityModule.NAME)

and put whatever configuration you need in the "global" context.


## Thanks

Thanks to:

- Arno for testing a snapshot build with a client application.
